**Geko** is a Web3 app designed to fix one of Latin America's invisible crises: people have access to banking, but not to **healthy financial habits**.

We combine **education, automation, and blockchain transparency** to help users **save, invest, and grow** . All through an experience so simple that Web3 becomes almost invisible.

## 🌎 The Problem

In Latin America:
- 70% of young adults have access to a bank account, but less than 15% actively save.  
- Cross-border transfers can cost up to **6%** in fees and take days to arrive.  
- Most fintech apps focus on *spending*, not *improving financial discipline*.

Traditional systems make it easy to consume, but hard to build financial stability.  
There’s no accessible way to **learn**, **save**, and **invest** consistently.

## 💡 Our Solution

**Geko** transforms financial habits using **Web3 technology** and **AI guidance**,  with an onboarding flow anyone can use.  

We help users:
1. **Save** – using personalized *Envelopes* that track goals.  
2. **Invest** – with *Easy Investing*, our simplified, automated Web3 investing feature.  
3. **Earn Rewards** – users get on-chain rewards for consistent behavior.  

Built on **Stellar**, Geko delivers near-zero-fee transactions, fast settlements, and a seamless user experience powered by **Stellar Wallet Kit**, so users can onboard in seconds, without much technical friction.
